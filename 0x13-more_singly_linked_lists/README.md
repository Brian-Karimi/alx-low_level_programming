Using linked list is useful because,

It allocates the memory dynamically. All the nodes of linked list are non-contiguously stored in the memory and linked together with the help of pointers.
Sizing is no longer a problem since we do not need to define its size at the time of declaration. List grows as per the program's demand and limited to the available memory space.
Traversing 
//node p;
p = head;
while(p != NULL){
    p = p->next;
}
Add Node To List
/**node addNode(node head, int value){
    node temp,p;// declare two nodes temp and p
    temp = createNode();//createNode will return a new node with data = value and next pointing to NULL.
    temp->data = value; // add element's value to data part of node
    if(head == NULL){
        head = temp;     //when linked list is empty
    }
    else{
        p  = head;//assign head to p 
        while(p->next != NULL){
            p = p->next;//traverse the list until p is the last node.The last node always points to NULL.
        }
        p->next = temp;//Point the previous last node to the new node created.
    }
    return head;
}
