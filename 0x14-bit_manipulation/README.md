Bit Manipulation
Bitwise Operators:
1: And (&) Operator: take two arguments to return a true
2: OR (|) Operator: take one argument to return true post evaluation
3: XOR (^) Operator: Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
4: Complement (~) Operator: Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the efect of 'flipping' bits.: 1 for 0 and 0 for 1
5: Binary Left Shift (<<) Operator: The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
6: Binary Right Shift (>>) Operator: he left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
